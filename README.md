# Introduction

The DropBlockEditor package provides you with a cool drag and drop editor. It allows you to easily create your own custom blocks and make them editable through Livewire components.

- > Note: This package is in the pre-release stage. Code is subject to change and should not considered stable at this time.

# Requirements

To use this package, you'll need:

- > To use with Livewire v3.
- > PHP 8.1 or higher

# Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```shell script
composer require mo_sweed/dropblockeditor
```

You can publish all files with:

```shell script
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Mo_sweed\DropBlockEditor\DropBlockEditorServiceProvider" â€“-force
```

Once all files are published, open `routes/web.php`, and add this code at the end of the page:

```php
require __DIR__.'/dropblockeditor.php';
```

After that, run this command:

```shell script
php artisan migrate
```

## Run the following artisan command to create a new Block with an edit component

```shell script
php artisan dropblockeditor:make Text
```
